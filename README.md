# project-5-Image-to-array-conversion-using-pil-np-plt.


Image plt using color changes ny python.
the project are very intersting image
to convert the plt.

With the help of NumPy, we can perform many functions on images like enlarging image, 
using different shades like red, green, blue or black and white

In the first step, we are going to NumPy for converting image pixels not matrix form, 
python image library used to add support for opening, 
manipulating and saving many different image file formats
and matplotlib is used for visualization for 2D plots of the array.

Here in the code below, we have used Image. 
open function to open the file that is already uploaded to our Jupyter Notebook and plt.
imshow function is used to show the image that is already uploaded in the image (reference variable).
